Stegnography<br>
This paper presents the Information hiding using Steganography. It is the right technique to exchange secret information over the internet. In particular, LSB modification technique has been keenly discussed. The major advantage of this technique is its flexibility and efficiency. Another added advantage is that is a spatial domain technique. There is no need to remember complex transform domain algorithms. Image steganography technique can be used to save important passwords and keys without visibility to the external world. It can also be used by the digital art makers to protect the copy rights of their digital arts by embedding their details into the work.<br>
Requirements are:<br>
